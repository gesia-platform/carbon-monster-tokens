# Voucher1155Nft Smart Contract

## üìñ Overview

The Voucher1155Nft Smart Contract is a versatile blockchain-based platform for issuing and managing voucher NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens). Deployed on the Gesia network, this contract allows for the creation, sale, and transfer of voucher NFTs in a secure and decentralized manner. It integrates with OpenZeppelin libraries and other external interfaces for enhanced functionality.

## ‚ú® Features

Minting and Managing Voucher NFTs (Owner Only): Enables the contract owner to mint new voucher NFTs and manage their properties.

Transfer By Signature (Owner Only): Facilitates secure transfers of NFTs via digital signatures, ensuring authenticated transactions.

Voucher NFT Pricing and Metadata Management: Allows for setting and updating the prices and metadata of voucher NFTs.

```
Core Functions:
- mintByOperator()
- mintBySignature()
- transferBySignature()
- getCarbonPrice()
```

## ‚ú® Features

Minting Carbon Credits (Operators Only): Operators can mint new carbon credit tokens, specifying the amount and metadata, while ensuring compliance with environmental standards.

Secure Transfer Mechanisms: Includes features for transferring tokens with signature verification, ensuring secure and authenticated transactions.

Carbon Pricing and Weight Management: Allows operators to set and update carbon prices and weights for each token.

```
Core Functions:
- mint()
- transferWithSignature()
- transferWithGift()
- getCarbonPrice()
- tokenWeight()
```
