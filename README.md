# Voucher1155DerivativeToken Smart Contract

## üìñ Overview

The Voucher1155DerivativeToken Smart Contract is a versatile blockchain-based platform for issuing and managing voucher Derivative Tokens. Deployed on the Gesia network, this contract allows for the creation, sale, and transfer of voucher Derivative Tokens in a secure and decentralized manner. It integrates with OpenZeppelin libraries and other external interfaces for enhanced functionality.

## ‚ú® Features

Minting and Managing Voucher Derivative Tokens (Owner Only): Enables the contract owner to mint new voucher Derivative Tokens and manage their properties.

Transfer By Signature (Owner Only): Facilitates secure transfers of Derivative Tokens via digital signatures, ensuring authenticated transactions.

Voucher Derivative Token Pricing and Metadata Management: Allows for setting and updating the prices and metadata of voucher Derivative Tokens.

```
Core Functions:
- mintByOperator()
- mintBySignature()
- transferBySignature()
- getCarbonPrice()
```

# Carbon1155DerivativeToken Smart Contract

## üìñ Overview

The Carbon1155DerivativeToken Smart Contract is a blockchain-based platform designed for managing and trading carbon credit tokens in the form of ERC1155 Derivative Tokens. This contract, deployed on the Gesia network, allows users to mint, transfer, and manage carbon credits securely and efficiently. It leverages OpenZeppelin libraries and integrates with various interfaces such as IOperator, IFeeManager, and IPrice for enhanced functionality.

## ‚ú® Features

Minting Carbon Credits (Operators Only): Operators can mint new carbon credit tokens, specifying the amount and metadata, while ensuring compliance with environmental standards.

Secure Transfer Mechanisms: Includes features for transferring tokens with signature verification, ensuring secure and authenticated transactions.

Carbon Pricing and Weight Management: Allows operators to set and update carbon prices and weights for each token.

```
Core Functions:
- mint()
- transferWithSignature()
- transferWithGift()
- getCarbonPrice()
- tokenWeight()
```
